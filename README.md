RDA Collections API
===================

This is a repository for an API Mockup of the RDA Collections API. The swagger file used is based off the master Swagger Spec generated by the working group, modified only slightly to include some implementation specific parameters.

It uses the python library [Connexion](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/connexion) to ensure compliance with the swagger spec and implement many of the higher level capabilities.

As a backend, it uses a simple Redis database as its backend. Member items and Collection metadata are stored simply as hashes in the backend. Collection membership is stored as sets (sorted sets for ordered collections). Union and intersection operations are implemented using the underlying redis operations, and all filtering is done within the API code itself, although it should be possible to implement set based secondary indexes to speed common filtering operations.
